feat: Add Advisory Node service for centralized quorum management

Implement a centralized advisory node service to replace manual quorum 
management in RubixGo platform. This service provides intelligent quorum 
discovery with balance validation and load balancing.

Key Features:
- REST API for quorum registration and discovery
- Balance validation (ensures quorums have transaction_amount/count RBT)
- Load balancing with round-robin assignment tracking
- Heartbeat mechanism (2-minute intervals) for availability tracking
- Automatic fallback to local management if advisory node unavailable
- Support for both SQLite and PostgreSQL databases
- DID type validation (0-4, including lite mode)

API Endpoints:
- POST /api/quorum/register - Register a quorum with balance
- POST /api/quorum/confirm-availability - Confirm quorum is available
- GET /api/quorum/available - Get quorums with balance validation
- PUT /api/quorum/balance - Update quorum balance
- POST /api/quorum/heartbeat - Send heartbeat signal
- GET /api/quorum/health - Check service health
- GET /api/quorum/info/:did - Get specific quorum information
- DELETE /api/quorum/unregister/:did - Unregister a quorum

Integration:
- Hardcoded port 8082 for RubixGo platform compatibility
- Automatic registration when nodes run SetupQuorum
- Replaces manual QuorumManager database entries
- Supports ~700 quorum nodes out of 10,000 total nodes

Technical Details:
- Built with Gin web framework for high performance
- GORM ORM for database operations
- In-memory store option for testing
- Configurable via command-line flags
- CORS support for cross-origin requests

This solves the scalability issue of manual quorum management and provides
a robust solution for quorum discovery in the RubixGo ecosystem.
