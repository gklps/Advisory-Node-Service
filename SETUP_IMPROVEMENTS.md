# Setup Script Improvements - Based on Real Deployment Experience

## 🎯 **Issues Identified and Fixed**

Based on the successful deployment and troubleshooting session, the following improvements have been implemented in the setup script:

### 1. **Database Permissions Issue** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: The original setup script created databases but didn't grant sufficient schema-level permissions, causing:
```
ERROR: permission denied for schema public (SQLSTATE 42501)
```

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added comprehensive database permissions during setup
- Made `advisory_user` the owner of both databases
- Granted schema-level privileges for table/sequence creation
- Added default privileges for future objects

**Code Added**:
```sql
-- Make user owner of databases (ensures all permissions)
ALTER DATABASE advisory_testnet OWNER TO advisory_user;
ALTER DATABASE advisory_mainnet OWNER TO advisory_user;

-- Connect to each database and set schema permissions
\c advisory_testnet
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA public TO advisory_user;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO advisory_user;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON SEQUENCES TO advisory_user;
```

### 2. **Service Startup Testing** ✅ ENHANCED

**Problem**: Original script didn't wait for services to fully initialize, causing false positives.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added 30-second initialization wait
- Implemented retry logic (10 attempts with 5-second intervals)
- Added comprehensive health checks
- Added database connectivity verification
- Detailed error reporting with logs

### 3. **File Detection Logic** ✅ IMPROVED

**Problem**: Script couldn't find `main.go` in different directory structures.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added multiple location search for main files
- Support for both `main.go` and `main_db.go`
- Better error reporting with location details
- Enhanced debugging information

### 4. **Service Management** ✅ ENHANCED

**Problem**: The `manage.sh` script wasn't handling commands properly.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Fixed command parsing and execution
- Added health check integration
- Enhanced logging with proper error handling
- Added network status monitoring

### 5. **Customization Options** ✅ ADDED

**Enhancement**: Added configuration flexibility for different deployments.

**Features Added**:
- Customizable database usernames
- Configurable ports for testnet/mainnet
- Custom database names
- Interactive configuration prompts
